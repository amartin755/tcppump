tcppump (0.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Many bug fixes
    unaligned accesses
    memory corruptions
    undefined behaviour in release builds
    memory leaks
  * Build support for CLANG
  * Build options for ASAN, UBSAN and valgrind
  * Privileges are no longer needed, when packets are written to pcap files.

tcppump (0.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: Fxed memory leak in case of packet compile errors
  * Bugfix: In some cases it wasn't possible to execute tcppump on interfaces
    where no ip address was set. MAC and IP address of the interface are now
    only mandatory, if packet definition depends on them. Thanks to Sascha
  * Configureable MTU (--mtu option)
  * IP- and MAC addresses can now be defined as random values in packets
    (e.g. smac=*)
  * Support for recursive packet definitions. Means, a packet can be defined
    as a payload of an other packet (via <> operator). This can be useful for
    encapsulation protocols like vxlan and GRE or for embedded payloads of
    ICMP packets.
  * New protocols: vxlan, GRE

tcppump (0.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
